# CRM-JavaApp

The files in this file are the bare minimum to run this app. To run it yourself, you would need to take the files and add them to an IntelliJ IDE project you create or copy and paste the code. 

Here are some important things to note with this project:

-The login page displays in French or English based in the user's OS settings. 
-The project was designed to connect to a specific MySQL databse. You can modify the code slightly to fit use your databas. 
-The appointment times are stored as timestamps and automatically adjust in the user interface. 
-Every log in attempt is logged.
-There are restrictions to adding/deleting customers and appointments. It should be clear what those restrictions are as you read through the code or use the app.
-The FXML pages were created with functionality in mind, not aesthetics.
